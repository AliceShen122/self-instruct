Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

You need to write out the calculation for getting the final answer.\nExample 1\nParagraph: Gun violence in the United States results in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries annually, and was the leading cause of death for children 19 and younger in 2020. In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.

In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

You need to write out the calculation for getting the final answer.\nExample 1\nParagraph: Gun violence in the United States results in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries annually, and was the leading cause of death for children 19 and younger in 2020. In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

You are given an array of integers. Return whether there exists any pair of numbers in this array whose sum is equal to 10.\n13. Write a function that takes two strings and outputs true if they are anagrams, otherwise false . Anagrams are words which have the same letters but different order. For example, \"racecar\" and \"caraecr\" are anagrams.\n14. Write a function that returns true if it is passed a palindrome string, otherwise false . A palindrome string reads the same backward as forward, for example, \"noon\".\n15. Write a function that counts how many vowels there are in a string. If there are more than one vowel, output \"multiple\".

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Again, thank you so much for your time and consideration.\nThanks again,\n[Your Name]\n\nTask: You have two coins. one is fair (probability of heads = 0.5) and the other is biased (probability of heads = 0.6). what is the smallest number of flips required to determine which coin is heavier if you only look at the total number of heads?\n", "response": {"choices": [{"text": "Output:\ndef coin_heaviness(p1, p2):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(10):\n        if p1 == 1 and p2 == 0:\n        total += 1\n    return total\n\n", "index": 3, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["Output", ":", "\n", "def", " coin", "_", "he", "av", "iness", "(", "p", "1", ",", " p", "2", "):", "\n", " ", " ", " ", " total", " =", " 0", "\n", " ", " ", " ", " for", " i", " in", " range", "(", "10", "):", "\n", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " if", " p", "1", " ==", " 1", " and", " p", "2", " ==", " 0", ":", "\n", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " total", " +=", " 1", "\n", " ", " ", " ", " return", " total", "\n", "\n"], "token_logprobs": [-0.4733044, -0.016624456, -1.9875728, -1.531551, -1.565959, -1.3143871, -1.1250615, -0.67027897, -0.43085968, -0.09571322, -2.0420957, -0.17798707, -0.03729551, -0.023956245, -0.0038934066, -0.06819017, -0.291863, -0.13211828, -0.048434038, -0.25107962, -1.3018132, -0.25390702, -0.034232944, -0.25842327, -0.07979672, -0.0024286367, -0.018850422, -0.35896614, -0.49968764, -0.002200175, -0.011878814, -0.04210063, -1.9559808, -0.16190447, -0.037047997, -0.043963987, -0.0056364946, -0.03748819, -0.38751778, -0.13002631, -0.48138243, -0.9195904, -0.521258, -1.123746, -0.09896876, -0.9701045, -0.7007608, -0.68465185, -0.15679447, -0.0073997304, -0.067508005, -0.46689478, -0.5568378, -0.11923237, -0.038588747, -0.010322097, -0.054615602, -0.14167081, -0.028163385, -0.038410842, -0.1928366, -1.0328475, -0.01072212, -0.33899537, -0.15408601, -0.048965972, -0.0016649051, -0.027906172, -1.1366997, -0.21339525, -0.80306965, -0.6574624], "top_logprobs": [{"Output": -0.4733044}, {":": -0.016624456}, {"\n": -1.9875728}, {"def": -1.531551}, {" coin": -1.565959}, {"_": -1.3143871}, {"he": -1.1250615}, {"av": -0.67027897}, {"iness": -0.43085968}, {"(": -0.09571322}, {"p": -2.0420957}, {"1": -0.17798707}, {",": -0.03729551}, {" p": -0.023956245}, {"2": -0.0038934066}, {"):": -0.06819017}, {"\n": -0.291863}, {" ": -0.13211828}, {" ": -0.048434038}, {" ": -0.25107962}, {" total": -1.3018132}, {" =": -0.25390702}, {" 0": -0.034232944}, {"\n": -0.25842327}, {" ": -0.07979672}, {" ": -0.0024286367}, {" ": -0.018850422}, {" for": -0.35896614}, {" i": -0.49968764}, {" in": -0.002200175}, {" range": -0.011878814}, {"(": -0.04210063}, {"10": -1.9559808}, {"):": -0.16190447}, {"\n": -0.037047997}, {" ": -0.043963987}, {" ": -0.0056364946}, {" ": -0.03748819}, {" ": -0.38751778}, {" ": -0.13002631}, {" ": -0.48138243}, {" ": -0.9195904}, {" if": -0.521258}, {" p": -1.123746}, {"1": -0.09896876}, {" ==": -0.9701045}, {" 1": -0.7007608}, {" and": -0.68465185}, {" p": -0.15679447}, {"2": -0.0073997304}, {" ==": -0.067508005}, {" 0": -0.46689478}, {":": -0.5568378}, {"\n": -0.11923237}, {" ": -0.038588747}, {" ": -0.010322097}, {" ": -0.054615602}, {" ": -0.14167081}, {" ": -0.028163385}, {" ": -0.038410842}, {" ": -0.1928366}, {" total": -1.0328475}, {" +=": -0.01072212}, {" 1": -0.33899537}, {"\n": -0.15408601}, {" ": -0.048965972}, {" ": -0.0016649051}, {" ": -0.027906172}, {" return": -1.1366997}, {" total": -0.21339525}, {"\n": -0.80306965}, {"\n": -0.6574624}], "text_offset": [5987, 5993, 5994, 5995, 5998, 6003, 6004, 6006, 6008, 6013, 6014, 6015, 6016, 6017, 6019, 6020, 6022, 6023, 6024, 6025, 6026, 6032, 6034, 6036, 6037, 6038, 6039, 6040, 6044, 6046, 6049, 6055, 6056, 6058, 6060, 6061, 6062, 6063, 6064, 6065, 6066, 6067, 6068, 6071, 6073, 6074, 6077, 6079, 6083, 6085, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092, 6093, 6094, 6095, 6096, 6097, 6098, 6099, 6100, 6106, 6109, 6111, 6112, 6113, 6114, 6115, 6122, 6128, 6129]}, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, "created_at": "2023-06-28 02:23:08.195432"}, "instruction_metadata": {"prompt": "Come up with a series of tasks:\n1.

In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

You need to write out the calculation for getting the final answer.\nExample 1\nParagraph: Gun violence in the United States results in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries annually, and was the leading cause of death for children 19 and younger in 2020. In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
